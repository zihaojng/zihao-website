Ever have a brilliant idea for a design, but the thought of opening Figma makes you want to scream?

In other words, you feel the vibe, but can't design the pixels.

You're not alone. The traditional design process is broken for most of us.

My background is in product management, not design. But using the system I'm about to show you, I've created our entire suite of creative assets: website, logos, brochures, sales collateral, trade show banners, you name it.

It's a playbook for non-designers to create professional, pixel-perfect assets. If developers are all about "vibe coding" these days, think of this as the playbook for "vibe designing." The secret is to stop being a designer and start being a director.

I use a "triad" of tools:
1.  A visual AI (like Lovable) to generate a first draft from a simple "vibe."
2.  An AI coding agent (like Cline, in VS Code) to refine the details with plain English.
3.  GitHub as the central hub that connects them.

This lets you use the right tool for the right jobâ€”a visual canvas for quick tweaks, and an AI agent for complex changes.

I wrote down the entire playbook. Part 1 just dropped. If you're someone with a creative vision who needs to create great-looking assets but gets blocked by design tools, this is for you.
